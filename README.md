### Accessibility

The website is made accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

- Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
- Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
- Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by WebAIM to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.
- Making menus accessible by indicating the current page as "current" for screen readers, aiding navigation and orientation.

By implementing the above measures the over all accessibiity of the website is enhanced.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

    This project was created using only HTML and CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

    Codeanywhere was used to create the codes and GitHub was used to create the repository for storage of the codes created in codeanywhere.

    In the final stages of the work, my Codeanywhere account was suspended for lack of workspace hours and therefore Gitpod was used to complete the work. This decision was timely and based on the advised of my wondeful mentor.

    GitHub was also used to share to share work with my mentor for review and for deployment of the website.

    Google Fonts were used in creating the website.

    Icons used in the website were taken from Font Awesome free icons.

    Images were taken from pexels.com free istock photos. All the images, home image, hero image and the images for meditation, mindfulenss and yoga were taken from pexels.com.

    The Google Dev Tools was used identify bugs and for debugging and to test responsiveness of the website to different screen sizes.

    Am I Responsive was used to check the various device breakpoints for responsive design. The page below shows the snapshots from Am I Responsive for the 2 pages of the website:

![Am I Responsive snapshot for the website page 1](./documents/sacred-pathways-iamresponsive.png)

    WAVE Evaluation tool was used to evaluate web accessibility within the browser.

![WAVE Evaluation snapshot](./documents/wave-evaluation-sacred-pathways.png)

    Unicorn Revealer was used to check overflow on the website. This was very useful in checking the overflow from menu navigation, sections, forms and footer.

![Unicorn Revealer snapshot](./documents/unicorn-revealer-overflow-sacred-pathways.png)

  Chrome Lighthouse was used to analyzed both pages of the website with the following results as shown in the snapshots of the reults:

![Sacred Pathways Lighthouse score page 1](./documents/sacred-pathways-lighthouse-score-page-1.png)

![Sacred Pathways Lighthouse score page 2](./documents/sacred-pathways-lighthouse-score-page-2.png)

## Deployment
  The depoymnent was done very early on in the project based on advice from my mentor.
  The deployment of the project was done in the following steps:

  -  Forking the repo: The repository was created in GitHub by forking a copy from the original Code Institute repo template. This was done on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button to create a copy of the original repository.
  - Launching in IDE: After forking the repository, it was cloned or copied into Codeanywhere and opened by creating a new workspace. 
  - Git add/commit/push to GitHub: With the project open in your Codeanywhere, changes were made to the codebase and after desired changes, Git commands to stage the modified files (git add), create a commit with a descriptive message (git commit), and push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub (git push) were done.
  - Settings: In the repository's settings on GitHub, the configuration of the branch from the main was done for deploymnent to setup up the branch for deployment.
  - Pages: GitHub Pages which has the facility to host your website directly from my GitHub repository was utilized. This was enabled in GitHub Pages by navigating to the repository's settings and locating the "GitHub Pages" section. Here, the branch to deploy was configured of the website's domain as required.
  - Choosing a branch & deploying: In the GitHub Pages settings, a selection of the branch that contains the code of the website. GitHub then built and deployed the website using the code from the selected main. The following deployment address was created from which the website can be accessed:

On the advice of my mentor, Lauren-Nicole, aria labels were added to all anchor tag. Also content between header & footer were wrapped in opening/closing set of main tags. 

Flexbox was employed upon the suggestion of my mentor during the first session of the project. This was to improve on responsivement and to reduce on the number of media queries to make all sections responsivie.

The back to top button was also implemented as a suggestion by my mentor to improve on interaction and responsiveness.
