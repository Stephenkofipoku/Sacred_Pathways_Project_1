### Accessibity

The website is made accessible-friendly as possible through the following measures:

- Utilizing semantic HTML to provide meaningful structure and enhance accessibility.
- Incorporating descriptive alt attributes for images on the site to provide alternative text for screen readers.
- Ensuring an adequate color contrast across the site to improve readability for users with visual impairments. I employed the contrast checker provided by WebAIM to validate the contrast ratio between the selected foreground color and background color.
- Making menus accessible by indicating the current page as "current" for screen readers, aiding navigation and orientation.

By implementing the above measures the over all accessibiity of the website is enhanced.
